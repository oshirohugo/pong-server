# Pong server

Websocket server used for a multiplayer pong

To run in development mode:

``` bash
yarn dev
```

To build:

``` bash
yarn build
```

To run the built code

``` bash
yarn start

## Disclaimer

This mode is just a prototype for a game server. If you are serious about build a server for your game look for something else to follow as a model. The messages are exchanged using JSON which is really bad practice. And there are no error treatment.
